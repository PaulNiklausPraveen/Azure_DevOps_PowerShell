Managing Azure DevOps using PowerShell involves leveraging the Azure DevOps Service Connection and REST API. We can create, update, or delete pipelines, manage repositories, and trigger builds or releases. PowerShell scripts can automate the setup of Service Connections, allowing secure access to Azure DevOps resources. Additionally, PowerShell enables querying project information, modifying permissions, and handling various administrative tasks, offering a versatile approach to Azure DevOps management.
